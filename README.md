# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. The word is represented by dashes, and each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed or the stick figure is completed.
